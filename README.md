## Vanilla JS modal: Soundsmitten fork

This is a simple modal plugin written in plain JavaScript. It uses CSS3 for transitions.

## Motivation

I needed a plugin without dependencies for my projects. I also practiced my JS skills with it. The modal is inspired by an article at scotch.io, "Building Your Own JavaScript Modal Plugin". Please visit their website for amazing hands-on tutorials.

## What's up with the Soundsmitten Fork?

I (Nick) used to spend a lot of time with Sencha's ExtJS 5, but there came a time that I needed to create a simple image uploader without any dependencies. This library is perfect for displaying simple response messages. I added ways to customize the dialog box in a pseudo-Sencha blocky-object fashion. The things I added are niche enough that it justified a fork.

## Using it

There are several examples of implementations at the end of the JS files. To test them, you'll need to uncomment the desired implementation.

## Contributors

This is just a simple plugin for my personal projects and to practice my JS abilities. You're more than welcome to contribute :)
